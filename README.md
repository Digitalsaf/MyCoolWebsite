# Welcome to my website about Agile and Scrum

## This website will briefly explain agile and scrum



### What is agile?

Firstly we will start with Agile, because in order to understand Scrum, you need to understand Agile.

Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.

#### What is Scrum?

Scrum is a subset of Agile. It is a lightweight process framework for agile development, and the most widely-used one. A “process framework” is a particular set of practices that must be followed in order for a process to be consistent with the framework.

Scrum is a framework the helps teams work together by following a set of rules and principles in order to get a job done.The teams usually include a product owner, a scrum master and the development team. Scrum uses something called sprints, an iteteration process that last for a week or two. Teams work on prioritized user stories and backlogs that will fit the time frame they have been given in order to provide the best outcome. Sprints have to be planned to by the scrum team to define what can be done and how the work will be achieved. In the sprint planning period, the scrum team will discuss product backlog items which is a prioritzed list of work for the development team that derives from the product roadmap and its requirements.

When you've finished a sprint, you're required to do a sprint review ceremony. A sprint review gives the chance to show off your work and reflect on how things went and what was done. Being part of a scrum team also means you have to do daily stand ups. Everyone in the scrum team comes together, usually at beginning of your work day. Each member of the team gives a brief update on what they've worked on the day before, what they're working on today and what issues are blocking them. These daily stands up shouldn't exceed 15 minutes.

To have a Scrum team, you have to have a scrum master. Scrum Masters serve as leaders of a scrum team. They are also facilitators for an agile development team, who are responsible for promoting and supporting scrum.They do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules and values.
Scrum teams have retrospective meeting for team members to reflect on their sprint and to identify action for improvement going forward.

Sometimes working on a big complex project requires a large amount of people and that's where scrum of scrums comes in. Scrum of Scrums is a technique used make a big group which is then seperated into smaller group. Each group is assinged an ambassador, who participates in daily meeting with the ambassadors from the other groups.
